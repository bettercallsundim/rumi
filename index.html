   The minute I heard my first love story,
   I started looking for you,
   not knowing how blind that was,
   Lovers don't finally meet somewhere.
   They're in each other all along.

   <strong>Love Dogs</strong>
  One night a man was crying, Allah! Allah!
  His lips grew sweet with the praising,
  until a cynic said,
  "So! I have heard you calling out,
  but have you ever
  gotten any response?"
  The man had no answer to that.
  He quit praying and fell into a confused sleep.</pre>

  He dreamed he saw Khidr, the guide of souls,
  in a thick, green foliage,
  <i>“Why did you stop praising?”</i>
  “Because I’ve never heard anything back.”
  <i>“This longing you express
  is the return message.
  The grief you cry out from
  draws you toward union.
  Your pure sadness that wants help
  is the secret cup.”</i>

  <i>Listen to the moan of a dog for its master.
  That whining is the connection.
  There are love dogs no one knows the names of.
  Give your life to be one of them.</i>
